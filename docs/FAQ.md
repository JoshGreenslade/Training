## Workflow Questions

### Q: What are GitHub Agentic Workflows?

**A**: Agentic Workflows are AI-powered GitHub Actions that:
- Use natural language instructions (markdown)

- Run in response to triggers

This training teaches you to build them!

### Q: Do I need to install anything?

**A**: No! Everything runs in GitHub:
- Workflows run in GitHub Actions
- Issues and Discussions are built-in
- No local setup required

For advanced challenges, you might optionally install `gh aw` CLI locally, but it's not required.

### Q: Why do some workflows take time to respond?

**A**: Workflows run as GitHub Actions, which:
- May queue if many are running
- Take time to start (30 seconds - 2 minutes)
- Run AI processing (can be 1-10 minutes)
- Generate and validate responses

Be patient! Usually responds within 5-10 minutes.

### Q: Can I see the workflow code?

**A**: Yes! All workflows are in `.github/workflows/`:
- `ai-first-training-orchestrator.md` - Main training logic
- `daily-ai-challenge.md` - Daily challenge generator
- `training-leaderboard.md` - Progress tracking
- `challenge-review-assistant.md` - Submission reviews
