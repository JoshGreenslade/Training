## Technical Questions

### Q: What happens when I submit the training form?

**A**: The AI Training Master workflow:
1. Receives your form submission
2. Creates a personalized training issue for you
3. Sets up your Level 1 curriculum
4. Initializes your XP tracking
5. Provides your first learning modules
(Usually within 5-10 minutes)

**A**: Your main training issue (created when you start) is your progress tracker. Comment `/progress` anytime to see:
- Current XP and level
- Completed modules
- Challenges finished
- Badges earned
- Next recommended steps

### Q: What if the AI Training Master doesn't respond?

**A**: First, wait 5-10 minutes (workflows can take time). If still no response:
1. Check that your issue has the `start-training` label
2. Look in the Actions tab to see if the workflow ran
3. Check for any error messages
4. If stuck, open a regular issue describing the problem

### Q: Can I restart or reset my training?

**A**: You can start a new training session by creating a new "Start Training" issue, but you'll lose previous progress. Instead:
- Use `/progress` to see where you are

3. It reviews your submission (PR or description)
4. Provides detailed feedback within 10-20 minutes
5. Awards XP based on quality
6. Suggests improvements

### Q: Do I have to do daily challenges?

## Workflow Questions

### Q: What are GitHub Agentic Workflows?

**A**: Agentic Workflows are AI-powered GitHub Actions that:
- Use natural language instructions (markdown)
- Execute autonomously
- Integrate with GitHub (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Can use external tools and APIs
- Run in response to triggers

This training teaches you to build them!

### Q: Do I need to install anything?

**A**: No! Everything runs in GitHub:
- Workflows run in GitHub Actions
- Issues and Discussions are built-in
- No local setup required

For advanced challenges, you might optionally install `gh aw` CLI locally, but it's not required.

### Q: Why do some workflows take time to respond?

**A**: Workflows run as GitHub Actions, which:
- May queue if many are running
- Take time to start (30 seconds - 2 minutes)
- Run AI processing (can be 1-10 minutes)
- Generate and validate responses

Be patient! Usually responds within 5-10 minutes.

### Q: Can I see the workflow code?

**A**: Yes! All workflows are in `.github/workflows/`:
- `ai-first-training-orchestrator.md` - Main training logic
- `daily-ai-challenge.md` - Daily challenge generator
- `training-leaderboard.md` - Progress tracking
- `challenge-review-assistant.md` - Submission reviews

Feel free to explore and learn from them!
